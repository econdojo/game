This course offers an introduction to game theory and its applications, building on the foundations developed in microeconomic principles. It will provide analytical tools and formal models to explain strategic interactions between rational decision-makers, including concepts of Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, extensive form games, and Bayesian games. This set of tools is used to understand strategic behavior in international relations. To optimize learning outcomes, this course incorporates artificial intelligence to enhance students' understanding of game-theoretic concepts. These AI tools provide personalized learning, real-time feedback, and practical application support. Finally, this course will help prepare students entering graduate education or starting careers in economics, political science, business strategy, or policy analysis.
